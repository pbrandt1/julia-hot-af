# Julia vs Matlab/Octave for Science!

Here we are going to propagate an orbit for 1000s using a j2/j3/j4 gravitational model in equinoctial coordinates.  The equations of motion in the equinoctial system are in the pdf on page 8 i think?

Anyway, we do hard maths.  Julia does it in ~1.9s, and octave does it in ~103.8s.

Way to go julia!
